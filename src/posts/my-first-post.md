Git restore is a powerful command that allows you to recover data from any commit in your Git repository. As the name implies, it restores files or entire directories to their previous state, either completely recreating them or merging individual differences between versions. This makes restoring data quick and easy when something goes wrong. 

At its simplest, git restore works like this: You just provide a pathname for the file you want to restore (or an entire directory) and then tell Git what condition you want it restored in. The "condition" can be either the exact version of the file as stored in the repository or a combination of different versions. In both cases, though, the restored version will replace any changes made to that particular file since its creation or last update. 

Git's restoration abilities don't stop there though; it also offers three ways to control how different versions are merged together: resetting specific files, reverting certain commits back to an earlier version if needed (even ones which were previously committed), and selectively cherry-picking changes as they were implemented over time into your branch using interactive rebase mode. 

Using these options together provides complete control over how exactly pieces of code evolve over time and allows developers more flexibility when troubleshooting problems with their project's source code without having to completely start from scratch every time something breaks down unexpectedly!

.Git restore is a powerful command used to recover files or directories that were deleted, either intentionally or unintentionally. This command works by retrieving content from the git repository and reapplying it in your working tree. 

...

At its simplest level, git restore can be used to retrieve a single file that was recently deleted: git restore < filename > This will regenerate the file as it was before it was removed from your staging area. However, if you have multiple files with the same name scattered across various locations in your project, this won’t always be enough. In those cases you may need to use more granular parameters than simple filenames: git restore --source=< commit > --staged < pathspec > Using this command will retrieve any version of the given pathspec from anywhere within a specified commit range, and then place them into your staging area for further processing. Furthermore, you can also use additional modifiers like “--force” or “--dry-run” if needed. If all else fails you could also opt for a brute force approach of checking out an entire previous version of your project using git revert followed by modifying the relevant parts manually: git checkout -f previous_commit_reference 

All in all Git Restore is an incredibly powerful tool once you know exactly what values to enter into each field – so take some time familiarizing yourself with additional scenarios where it can come in handy!
